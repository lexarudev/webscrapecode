# Web-Scraping-Code
This is code that was used for How To Make Money, Using Web Scraping

The Web Scraping application used was Scrapy which is a more advanced library to web scrape. It involves this code but is also performed using the anaconda prompt/console

If your starting Web Scraping for the first time I recommend using a libray called Beautiful Soup, it's typically easier to start with.
